        <p>The squash and stretch principle is considered the most important of the 12 principles of animation. <br>
        When applied, it gives your animated characters and objects the illusion of gravity, weight, mass and flexibility. <br>
        Think about how a bouncing rubber ball may react when tossed into the air: the ball stretches when it travels up and down and squishes when it hits the ground.<br>
        When using squash and stretch, it's important to keep the object's volume consistent. <br>
        So when you stretch something it needs to get thinner, and when you squash something it needs to get wider.</p>
